# Museum-Protector
This device protects its objectives with laser and LDR.
Product Introduction:
This museum guard has detectors that are sensitive to the movement of valuable objects through a distance sensor (sharp) and can also be sensitive to the entry of foreign objects (such as hands) into the enclosure through sensors (laser & LDR).

How the device works:
With the keyboard intended for the museum guard, the user can activate or deactivate the alarm by entering the correct password, or the administrator can change the alarm password by knowing the previous password.
Also, a miniature siren, which consists of three LEDs and a buzzer horn, informs the security forces about theft.
